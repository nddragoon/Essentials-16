# Just Enough Mods 16
A 1.16 kitchensink modpack designed around polish, quality of life, and including as many content mods as possible.

## Features so far
This pack is still in pretty early development, but I'm hoping the release that is out is already in a mostly playable state. Some basic features have been implemented so far:
- Most materials unified, including worldgen, under Emendatus Enigmatica.
- Extensive modlist, including as many large content mods as possible, and avoiding mods that circumvent others.
- Custom Bees

## Roadmap
- Recipes for creative items, gated behind progression through most or all of the large content mods.
- Quests

## Special Thanks
- Ridanisaurus: Custom textures
- NillerMedDild: Letting me borrow code from Enigmatica 6
- Lady Lexxie, The Boo, TemperedFool: Lots of help with KubeJS
